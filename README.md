## What It Does

NeuroFlow helps you:
- Write and organize notes
- Get AI summaries and key points
- Plan goals and break them into steps
- Track your learning over time
- Chat with friends and share progress
- Get weekly insights from your own work and conversations

It’s like having your own personal assistant, planner, and accountability partner all in one place.

## Why I’m Building It

I’ve used lots of tools that do one thing well—but nothing that connects all the parts of my learning, planning, and conversations.  
I’m building NeuroFlow to change that—and to push my own limits as a developer.
